            Although Naoki Ikushima has come into prominence as of late because of his work at the video game company
            Square Enix, there's barely any information on his biography. Because of that, my goal in writing this is to
            simply showcase his work, highlight what I enjoy about it, and why I like it so much.

            <h3 id="OT">Octopath Traveler</h3>
            <p>
                Octopath Traveler is the first game I engaged with Ikushima's work! I was struck by the visual on the
                box art by how much detail there was.

                style="width: 200px;">
            <p>
                The game revolves around eight characters traveling around the world to each resolve their personal
                stories. Much of the concepts behind a lot of the key art focuses on either the characters or traveling.
                The art really showcases the variety of backgrounds each character comes from, especially in the
                independent illustrations where the environments are more focused on the character.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite part about Ikushima's art is how incredibly detailed it is. His work primarily uses
                traditional media like pencil and watercolor. It's more than enough to emphasize the variety of
                environments on the world map, you see where the tundra transitons into a thick forest, and how that
                becomes mountainous as large cliffsides and plateaus rise above the land.

            <p>
                When you look at the characters, their clothes give you a sense of who they are and their backgrounds.
                Visually, Ikushima does a fantastic job with lighting. You see the highlights where the light hits their
                hair and clothing, and there's never any kind of true black, only darker shades to provide the best
                contrast possible between all the characters. Blacks will have hints of purple, whites will have hints
                of blue, even the ground, while dark to provide the best contrast, still has hints of color, and it's
                gorgeous.

            <h3 id="TS">Triangle Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                The moment this game was announced, I was instantly sucked in. I like takes on fantasy war stories, and
                it was the exact same aesthetic that drew me to Octopath Traveler. The atmosphere however, is completely
                different from Octopath.
            </p>

                alt="illustration of a young man with a sword standing in what appears to be a battlefield. He looks into the distance where there is smoke and a flock of birds flying away from the apparent conflict."
                style="width: 200px;">
            <p>
                Octopath is largely very bright, and that's largely because the theme is adventure. There's a lot of
                parchment textures to resemble maps and bright colors depicting locations that are traveled to. In
                comparison, Triangle Strategy has a much darker atmosphere. If you look closely enough, you can see that
                our main character is actually standing in a battlefield. The ground is dark with a tinge of blue and
                orange, with weapons and armor hidden in the grass. In the distance, there's smoke and birds flying away
                from the apparent conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's such a good atmosphere to sum up a tactical war game, and I love the sparks of orange to subtly
                show where our main character is and what's happening.

            <h3 id="LAL">LIVE A LIVE (2022 remake)</h3>
            <p>
                I actually don't know much about this game! It came out exclusively in Japan way before I was even born.
                The idea is that the player is following these characters from across time as they follow their own
                character stories. But, Ikushima does a great job showcasing that variety, and their respective designs
                are all incredibly different and charming.
